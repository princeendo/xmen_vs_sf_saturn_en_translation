# Research Log

This chronological journal preserves both successful and failed work. Durable,
confirmed findings are separately summarized in `docs/discoveries.md`.

## 2026-10-27 — SESSION-0001: repository set up

Task: ENV-001 to ENV-006, DOC-001

Goal: create the repository from the MSHvSF project's method, and record the
Saturn source image before any research.

User decisions (2026-10-27):

- XvSF "absolutely needs the 4M cart" (the user's statement; `EMU-004`
  confirms the emulator setting).
- Machine-local agent guidance goes in `local_agent_guidance.md`, listed in
  `.gitignore`.
- The MSHvSF playbook was to be brought up to date before this repository was
  populated. Done as MSHvSF commit `e70e60b`.

Action:

- Rules: `AGENTS.md` adapted from MSHvSF. Rules 13, 16, 24 and 25 were
  rewritten for this direction (MSHvSF is the read-only reference), and rule
  26 (provenance for copied code) was added. A "Before Each Session" section
  points to `local_agent_guidance.md`.
- Scaffolding: `pyproject.toml` (renamed), `setup_venv.sh`, `invenv.sh`,
  `LICENSE`, the research protocol, and the experiment template, copied from
  MSHvSF. `tools/disc/hash_source.py` and its test were copied unchanged from
  MSHvSF commit `f871e21`, with a provenance note.
- `.gitignore`: MSHvSF's list plus `local_agent_guidance.md`.
  `git check-ignore` confirmed `local/` and the guidance file are ignored.
- Source image: `~/Downloads/xmvsf/X-Men vs. Street Fighter (Japan) (3M).7z`
  (364,853,662 bytes, SHA-256
  `31957de13041636e9c2d8c333b77b78043ff9c7db141c78c2f7454bd02a43345`) was
  listed with `bsdtar -tvf`, then extracted with `bsdtar -xf` into the new,
  empty, ignored folder `local/disc_images/xmvsf_saturn_jp_3m/`.
  `./invenv.sh python -m tools.disc.hash_source --json ...` hashed all 42
  files; an independent `shasum -a 256` agreed on every file.
- Comparison with the old rip: a script compared bytes 16-2063 of each
  2352-byte sector of Track 01 with consecutive 2048-byte blocks of the
  MSHvSF-held ISO (`e2b65dfd…`).

Result:

- Header `T-1226G V1.002 19970925`, area `J`, the same as the old rip.
- Track 01 is `MODE1/2352`, 71,908 sectors. Sectors 0-71,905 equal the old
  ISO's data byte for byte. Sectors 71,906-71,907 are Mode 1 with zero user
  data. Tracks 02-41 are audio.
- `./invenv.sh pytest -q`: 4 passed. `ruff check`, `ruff format --check`, and
  `mypy` (strict): clean. uv 0.11.7, Python 3.13.13.

Conclusion: the image's identity is **SUPPORTED** (header, names and layout
agree; same data as the earlier rip) but not database-verified (`ENV-007`,
`BACKLOG`). It replaces the old ISO-plus-MP3 rip for all purposes.

Next action: `EMU-001` (pin and build stock Mednafen; ask before downloading),
`REF-001` and `REF-002` (arcade and PS1 intake), and `DOC-002` (ask the user to
confirm the carried-over decisions).
