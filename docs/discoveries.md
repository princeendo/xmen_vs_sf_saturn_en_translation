# Confirmed Discoveries

Only durable `CONFIRMED` findings about XvSF belong here, each with its evidence
(experiment, task) and reproduction instructions. Hypotheses and failures go in
`research_log.md`; open questions go in `docs/known_unknowns.md`.

MSHvSF findings are never recorded here. An MSHvSF finding enters this file only
after an XvSF experiment confirms the XvSF equivalent.

## D-001: Stock Mednafen cold-boots XvSF to the title screen (`EMU-003`, `EXP-0001`)

Stock Mednafen 1.32.1 (`892bb60a…29dd`) with the Japanese BIOS `sega_101.bin`
(`dcfef4b9…deac`) and the silent home `local/mednafen_quiet/` cold-boots the
untouched source image with no input. The log reports `SGID: T-1226G`,
`SGAREA: J` and `Cart: 4MiB Extended RAM` (`ss.cart auto`). The title logo with
`PRESS START BUTTON` shows from about 68 s to 75 s after launch. Three boots
gave byte-identical frames at one-second sampling; title frame 070 hashes
`ebfbb7da…e662`. Source hashes were unchanged.
